# Namaste, people :pray:

I do like to code on occasion, it's true! trust me :nerd_face: . In my latest job I work with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) to help increase property tax collection of district bodies; [Jodhpur](https://nnjsouth.in/properties/map) and [Bharatpur](https://udtbharatpurmc.co.in/properties/map) of the state Rajasthan. We at [YCSPL](ycspl.in) are also working on to build Admin site for the housing scheme of government of India called, [Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana](https://pmaymis.gov.in/). All of the above projects are using Angular and Angular Material as frontend. 

In my last job at [Scripbox](scripbox.com) I was responsible for Portfolio Audit feature for mutual funds, which did analysis of user's portfolio and recommended funds to exit from and reinvest in. Entire flow was done form both React Native and React using Flux as state management library. 

Previously, I made Low-Code/No-Code product called [TurboApps](https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-0000059950_live_v1/Turbo%20Forms%20-%20Mobile%20Forms%20&%20Data%20Collection%20App) with Angular, Angular Material, Formio and Retejs for [Unvired](https://unvired.com). I also run a twitter account called [Indian Olympic Dream](https://twitter.com/olympic_indian) which is a social handle of [indianolympicdream](https://github.com/agrawalankush/indianolympicdream); project I built using MongoDB, Angular, Express and Node to make it easy for normal folk to follow Olympic cycle from Indian perspective. 

I love Sports and TV shows. Also Leeds United. I believe The Office(US) after The Wire is arguably the second Best TV show ever made.
