# Namaste, people :wave:

I do like to code on occasion, it's true! trust me :nerd_face: . My latest deal is I'm making Low-Code/No-Code product [TurboApps](https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-0000059950_live_v1/Turbo%20Forms%20-%20Mobile%20Forms%20&%20Data%20Collection%20App) with Angular, Angular Material, Formio and Retejs for [Unvired](https://unvired.com), where I currently work. I also run a twitter account called [Indian Olympic Dream](https://twitter.com/olympic_indian) which is a social handle of [indianolympicdream](https://github.com/agrawalankush/indianolympicdream); project I built using MongoDB, Angular, Express and Node to make it easy for normal folk to follow Olympic cycle from Indian perspective. 

I love Sports and TV shows. Also Leeds United. I believe The Office(US) after The Wire is arguably the second Best TV show ever made.
